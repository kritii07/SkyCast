## Technologies Used

## Usage

1. Open the application in your web browser.

## API Integration

SkyCast uses the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to fetch real-time weather data. You need to sign up and get an API key from OpenWeatherMap to use this service. Update the `API_KEY` variable in the JavaScript file with your API key:

```javascript
const API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE';
```
